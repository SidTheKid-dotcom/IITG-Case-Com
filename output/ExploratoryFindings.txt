        Majority of customers are between 30 and 54 years (IQR).
    Tenure:
        Mean: 32 months, Range: 1–60 months.
        Median tenure is 33 months, indicating a moderate distribution of customer longevity.
    Service Usage Rate:
        Mean: 15, Range: 1–30.
        Usage patterns seem diverse with an IQR of 7–23.
    Support Calls:
        Average of 5.4 calls, Range: 0–10.
        50% of customers make 3–8 support calls.
    Billing Delay:
        Average: 17 occurrences, Range: 0–30.
        Distribution skewed toward higher values.
    Total Expenditure:
        Mean: ₹542, Range: ₹100–₹1000.
        Majority spend between ₹314 and ₹772.
    Recent Activity:
        Average: 15 interactions, Range: 1–30.
        Median activity level is high at 16 interactions.

3. Target Variable (Churn)

    Class Distribution:
        Not Churned (0): 52.65% of customers.
        Churned (1): 47.35% of customers.
        Balanced distribution, suitable for predictive modeling.

Visual Analysis
1. Distributions of Numeric Attributes

    Customer Age:
        Bell-shaped distribution centered around 40–45 years.
        No extreme outliers observed.
    Tenure:
        Skewed toward lower values, with a majority having tenure under 40 months.
        Drop-off after 60 months aligns with dataset limits.
    Service Usage Rate:
        Fairly even distribution with a peak around 15.
    Support Calls:
        Most customers make between 3–8 calls.
        Few customers with no calls or the maximum of 10.
    Billing Delay:
        High concentration around the upper range, suggesting common delays.
    Total Expenditure:
        Nearly uniform distribution with slight peaks in the middle range.
    Recent Activity:
        Significant activity clustered between 10–25 interactions.

2. Correlation Insights

    Strongest positive correlation with Churn:
        Billing Delay (0.43): Frequent delays might contribute to churn.
        Support Calls (0.30): More calls indicate unresolved issues.
    Weak correlations:
        Customer Age, Total Expenditure, and Recent Activity show minimal direct impact on churn.
    Negative correlation:
        Tenure (-0.40): Longer tenure suggests better retention.
